Palantir Technologies is a mission-driven company, and a core component of that mission is protecting our fundamental rights to privacy and civil liberties.
Since its inception, Palantir has invested its intellectual and financial capital in engineering technology that can be used to solve the world’s hardest problems while simultaneously protecting individual liberty.
Robust privacy and civil liberties protections are essential to building public confidence in the management of data, and thus are an essential part of any information system that uses Palantir software.
For ten years, we’ve built our company by being unconventional and open-minded.
We’ve been willing to try things that people said would never work, and we’ve adapted when we’ve been wrong.
Where we’ve succeeded, it’s because we’ve been different.
To succeed, we need the very best ideas of all kinds.
To access the broadest and fullest set of ideas, our community must attract and encourage people of diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and life experiences.
We work every day to build a truly diverse workforce, and to foster an environment that is respectful and receptive to new ideas.
We celebrate difference and diversity — of background, approach, and identity.
